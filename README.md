# IncomeForecaster: A Random Forest Odyssey
<img src = "/alex_income_pred.jpg">

# Introduction
An individual's annual income can be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as education level, age, gender, occupation, and more. By developing a predictive model for income, we gain valuable insights into the dynamics of these contributing factors over time. This allows for a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends that affect income levels annually. Moreover, employers can use these predictions to make data-driven decisions related to employee compensation, workforce planning, and talent acquisition. Also, policymakers can benefit from insights into income trends to formulate effective economics policies and social programs.

# Data Source
The dataset consists of 14 attributes, including our variable of interest - income, which has been divided into two classes: â‰¤ 50K and > 50K. You can download it here:

# Analysis Objective
The project aims to address the following questions:

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. What is the class distribution in the target variable "Income" (<=50K and >50K)?
2. How are different demographic variables distributed in the dataset?
3. What is the average age of individuals in the dataset?
4. What is the gender ratio?

**Correlations:**

1. Is there any correlation between age and income?
2. How does education influence income?

# Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis: 
1. Using univariate and bivariate analyses to identify patterns and correlations between variables.

Algorithm

1. One hot encoding
2. Random Forest
